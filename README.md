### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm Jonas. I'm currently training to become an IT specialist for application development and spend a lot of my time turning creative ideas into working code. Programming is more than just a job for me - it's my passion. I'm currently working particularly hard on EternalEmpires, an epic Minecraft MMORPG project that combines many of my interests: game mechanics, system design, technical depth and creative freedom. In my free time, I like to travel, discover new places and find the necessary balance to the digital world in nature. In winter, I often go snowboarding - speed, fresh air and the thrill of movement are just as important to me as clean architecture in code. On GitHub, I share selected projects and experiments that are important to me or where I was able to learn something new - always with the aim of getting better and developing my ideas further.

I publish most of the code in the [Interguess organization](https://github.com/Interguess) or the [EternalEmpires organization](https://github.com/EternalEmpires). Have a look there if you are interested in my work.
