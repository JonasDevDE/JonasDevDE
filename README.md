### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Hey, I'm Jonas. I'm training to become an IT specialist for application development and love turning creative ideas into code. I'm currently focused on *EternalEmpires*, a Minecraft MMORPG that blends game mechanics, system design, and creative freedom. Outside of coding, I enjoy traveling, nature, and snowboarding â€“ the balance between tech and the outdoors keeps me inspired. On GitHub, I share projects and experiments that help me grow and refine my ideas.

I publish most of the code in the [Interguess organization](https://github.com/Interguess) or the [EternalEmpires organization](https://github.com/EternalEmpires). Have a look there if you are interested in my work.
